## Dictonaries

Dictonaries in python are the same thing as a hashtable

Create a dictonary and add a key/value pair to it

```python
# creates an empty dict
my_dict = {}

# sets the 0 key to 'the string' and it's value to "i'm a string"
my_dict['the_string'] = "i'm a string"

# prints the dict
print(my_dict)
```
```output
{'the_string': "i'm a string"}
```
